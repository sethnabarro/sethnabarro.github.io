I am a machine learning PhD student at Imperial College London, supervised by [Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk/) and [Andrew Davison](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd/). 

I studied physics at Imperial for my undergrad degree, followed by a master's degree in computational statistics and machine learning at University College London. Before starting my PhD I was a research engineer at [Graphcore](https://www.graphcore.ai/), looking at hardware acceleration of probabilistic machine learning. 

Among other things I am interested in Bayesian deep learning, Bayesian model selection, local and distributed learning methods, generative modelling.
